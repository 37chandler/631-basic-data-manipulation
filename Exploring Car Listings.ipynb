    "# Assignment 1: Car Listings Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first required assignment. This notebook will guide you through exploring, cleaning, and transforming a real dataset of car listings from Craigslist.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please read these instructions carefully before you begin:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI use**: You may use AI to *ask questions* if you are stuck or need clarification. However, do not use AI code-completion or copy/paste code from AI. The purpose of this assignment is for you to gain fluency with Pandas by writing code yourself.  \n",
    "- **Questions**: Look for cells marked with `Q:`. These contain questions you must answer, either in code or in Markdown.  \n",
    "- **Markdown**: Use Markdown cells to explain your results, interpret outputs, and format your answers neatly. Clear communication is part of the assignment.  \n",
    "- **Output**: Ensure your notebook runs top-to-bottom without errors. Remove stray debug code before submitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you should feel more comfortable working with Pandas and preparing real-world data for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you've finished your work on this notebook, restart the kernel, clear the outputs, and run all cells to ensure everything works as expected. Then commit and push your changes to GitHub. Comment out any cells that are printing large outputs or dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've placed blank code cells where you need to write code, but don't feel like you have to do all the work for a given part in a single cell. I like to have each step in its own cell, so I can see the output and check my work as I go. You don't need to write a ton for these answers, fyi.\n"
